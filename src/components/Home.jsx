          The curious, adventure-seeking, fourth grade group of 10 year old
          boys, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny, all join in in buffoonish
          adventures that sometimes evolve nothing. Sometimes something that was
          simple at the start, turns out to get out of control. Everything is
          odd in the small mountain town, South Park, and the boys always find
          something to do with it.
